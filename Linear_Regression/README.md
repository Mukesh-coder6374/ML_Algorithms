## 🧠 What I Learned

- How a linear model fits a line to data points using the formula:
  \[
  y = wx + b
  \]
- How to define a loss function (Mean Squared Error) for evaluating prediction error.
- How **Gradient Descent** minimizes the error by updating weights `w` and bias `b` iteratively:
  \[
  w = w - \alpha \cdot \frac{\partial L}{\partial w}
  \quad , \quad
  b = b - \alpha \cdot \frac{\partial L}{\partial b}
  \]
- How to implement each of these steps programmatically from scratch using only NumPy.

## 🔁 Next Steps

This is part of my **daily ML learning routine**, where I:
- Understand the math 🔢  
- Write the algorithm from scratch 🧠  
- Document and share the results publicly 🌍  

Stay tuned for upcoming algorithms in this repository like:
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Decision Trees
- SVM, and more!
